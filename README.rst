Cython and interrupts
---------------------

When writing `Cython <http://cython.org/>`_ code, special care must be
taken to ensure that the code can be interrupted with ``CTRL-C``.
Since Cython optimizes for speed, Cython normally does not check for
interrupts. For example, code like the following cannot be interrupted
in Cython::

    while True:
        pass

The ``cysignals`` package provides mechanisms to handle interrupts (and other
signals and errors) in Cython code.

Requirements
------------

- Python >= 3.6
- Cython >= 0.28
- Sphinx >= 1.6 (for building the documentation)

Optional Runtime Requirements
-----------------------------

- cypari >= 2.1.3 (for interfacing with the PARI/GP signal handler)
